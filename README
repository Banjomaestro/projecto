Projet IMACTRONUS made by Lilou ALIDOR, Benjamin AMRANI, Lou COUARD, Pauline GOBE, RÃ©mi POIROUX

Try the website here : http://prof-patronus.fr/
Create an account and play !

To try in local : 

- Clone the repo
- Create your database in local
- Fill the database by copy/paste the content of the file "lilouBDD.sql" from codeigniter-FW in your SQL server.
- You should put a .env file at the root of the codeigniter-FW folder (it exists as a downloadable file on codeigniter's official website)
-In the .env file decomment the lines 40 to 45 :
    -- set "database.default.hostname = localhost"
    -- set "database.default.database = your database name"
    -- set "database.default.username = the username you use in mySQL"
    -- set "database.default.password = your mySQL password"
    -- set "database.default.DBDriver = MySQLi"
    -- let "database.default.DBPrefix = "

Congrats ! The database is connected to the php files !

- To launch the website, place yourself in codeigniter-FW and write in terminal "php spark serve"
- Go to you navigator and go to the localhost told by the terminal (should be localhost:8080)

You can now launch the website in local !
